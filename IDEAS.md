1. 🔥 Sudden Death
One wrong answer ends the exam immediately. Score is based on how far you got. Great for confidence-building and identifying knowledge gaps early.

2. ⏳ Adaptive Pressure
Timer starts generous but shrinks per question based on your streak. Get 3 in a row correct → next question gets fewer seconds. Get one wrong → timer resets to a comfortable level. Tests performance under increasing pressure.

3. 🎯 Bounty Hunt
Each question has a point value based on difficulty/domain. You see the point values and choose which questions to attempt from a board (like Jeopardy). Unanswered questions score 0, wrong answers deduct partial points. Strategy matters.

4. 🧠 Spaced Repetition / Weakest Link
The app pulls questions weighted toward your historically worst domains (using your analyticsDomains data). Questions you've previously gotten wrong appear more frequently. It's a targeted practice session rather than a random sample.

5. ⚡ Speed Run
No fixed timer — instead, you're racing the clock per question and your total elapsed time is your score. All questions must be answered. Leaderboard ranks by fastest completion with a minimum accuracy threshold (e.g., 70%+). Wrong answers add a time penalty (e.g., +30s).

6. 🪜 Ladder / Streak Challenge
Questions escalate in difficulty. You climb "levels" with each correct answer. Getting one wrong drops you back a level. Goal: reach the top level. Ties into your gamification system naturally (bonus XP for higher levels reached).

7. 👥 Duel Mode (Async)
Challenge another user. Both get the same question set. Scores are compared when both finish. Could work asynchronously — player 1 completes, player 2 gets notified and takes the same set. Integrates with your existing leaderboard.

8. 🔀 Elimination Rounds
Start with e.g. 4 choices per question. In round 1, answer normally. In round 2, questions you got wrong return but with one wrong choice removed. Round 3 removes another. Tests whether you can narrow down even when unsure.
